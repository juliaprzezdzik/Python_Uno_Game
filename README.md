This is our implementation of popular card game "Uno". In the deck of cards there are green, blue, red and yellow cards with numbers from 0 to 9. There are also extra cards, like block, +2 or +4. Each player has 7 cards at the begginng. The game starts with random card taken from the stack of cards. Every player has to put on the stack a card that is either the same color or the same number as the card on the stack. They can also use extra cards. The person who will get rid of their cards first is the winner of the game.
